# MQL4-Expert-Advisors
Automated stock/forex trading software

<b>What is this?</b>

This Repo is a collection of my MQL4 Scripts. Some of them were published in and developed for my book <a href="https://goo.gl/sE0aPm">"Algorithmisches Trading - MetaTrader4 MQL4"</a>. My book was published on 12.2015 by Tredition and explains (on german) how to develop automated trading strategies/software with the programming language MQL4 using its own IDE called "MetaEditor". 


<b>What is MQL4?</b>

MQL4 is a programming language for the free trading platform "<a href="https://www.metatrader4.com/en/download">MetaTrader4</a>". MQL4 is similar to C++ and allows you to effectively create automated trading strategies, which buy, sell and modify your orders on the stock market. <a href="https://docs.mql4.com/">MQL4 Documentation</a>.


<b>What comes next?</b>

Next, you can submit your own Expert Advisor to share it with other traders and investors. I do not publish every EA i do code, since most of them are being developed for my clients and thus can't be published. If you speak german, you can order my book "Algorithmisches Trading - MetaTrader4 MQL4" and learn how to develop your own automated trading strategies.
